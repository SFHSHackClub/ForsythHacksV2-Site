## About
Welcome to the 2nd annual Official Forsyth County hackathon for high school students.

Forsyth Hacks 2.0 ⚡ is a FREE full-day high school hackathon (social coding event) for building projects, getting mentored, meeting other like-minded STEM students, and having fun for any high schooler that attends a Forsyth County school.

This event is an opportunity for students to explore the realm of computer science and bring their creative ideas to life through a collaborative and competitive experience. Students will form groups and work together on a coding project based on the theme and then present them at the end. 

Create projects, memories, and guide the story of your STEM journey at Forsyth Hacks!
